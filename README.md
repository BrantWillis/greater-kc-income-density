I created this project to learn the basics of GIS (QGIS specifically) and explore Census data in a way I haven't seen online before. I took median household income data from 2010 and 2020 to create a map approximating income density by tract in the Kansas City metro area. I had to use Excel to stitch together the data, as the tract shapefiles and tract income are delivered separately. The results were very interesting, albeit mostly in line with what I expected. Areas that saw the most growth were the exurban edges of the metro and the urban core. Areas that saw the most stagnation or decline were second-ring suburbs and economically depressed neighborhoods (though some of these areas also saw the largest growth). In both 2010 and 2020, income density fairly closely matched walkability. Percent change in the urban core closely followed revitalization efforts of the last decade.
